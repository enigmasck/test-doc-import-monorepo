# SubmissionEvent
The SubmissionEvent model captures significant events that are performed by an agent and occur against a [Submission](Submission.md). In the current implementation, the agent will be a PASS [User](User.md). The definition of "significant" will evolve depending on which events are useful to capture in order to e.g. trigger notifications, or form an audit trail. The events that are currently deemed significant for capture are documented under [`eventType`](#event-type-options).

| Field  		| Type  		| Description |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| id* | String | Autogenerated identifier of object |
| eventType* | String | The type of event ([_see list below_](#event-type-options)) |
| performedDate* | String | DateTime the event was performed by the [User](User.md) |
| performerRole | String | Role of the person performing the event ([_see list below_](#performer-role-options)) |
| comment | String | A comment relevant to the SubmissionEvent. For example, when a `changes-requested` event occurs, this might be added by the User through the UI to communicate what changes should be made. |

| Value  					| Description |

| cancelled | A Submission was prepared and then cancelled by the `submitter` or `preparer` without being submitted. No further edits can be made to the Submission. |
| submitted | The submit button has been pressed through the UI. | 

## Performer role options
